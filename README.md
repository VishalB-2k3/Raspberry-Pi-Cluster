# Raspberry-Pi-Cluster

Excited to embark on an upcoming project where I will be diving into the world of the Pi Cluster! My aim is to leverage the computing power of Raspberry Pi boards along with Kubernetes and Docker to create a robust home supercomputer. I have ambitious goals of building a versatile platform for home labs, self-hosted private clouds, web servers, NAS, Ad-Blocker, multimedia conversion, CI/CD pipelines, and home automation.
